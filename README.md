# dimensionality-reduction
We use principal component analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction.

## Example Dataset
To understand how PCA works, we start first start with a 2D dataset which which has
one direction of large variation and one of smaller variation. The script file tests/ExampleDataset.m
will plot the training data (*Figure to be added later*). We will visualize what happen when we use
PCA to reduce the data from 2D to 1D. In practice. we want
to reduce data from say 256 to 50 dimensions; however, using lower dimensional data makes it easier 
for us to visualize the algorithms.

## To-Do List
- [ ] implement tests/ExampleDataset.m
- [ ] create figures for Example Dataset
